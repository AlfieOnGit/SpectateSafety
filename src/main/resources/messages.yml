#

#
#    OVERVIEW
#

#  This is the messages configuration file for AlfieJay's Spectate Safety. In this file you can
#  customise command feedback


#
#    PLACEHOLDERS
#

#  Below are listed all the built-in placeholders that'll be replaced by variables dependent on
#  context. If you make a custom placeholder with the same name, it'll override the built in one

#  Placeholder directory:
#  {COMMAND} = The command usage
#  {COUNT} = The number of player affected (not including targets whose gamemodes weren't changed)
#  {DEPENDENCY} = The name of the dependency
#  {DESCRIPTION} = The command description
#  {FOUND} = Whether or not a dependency was found in the plugins folder
#  {GROUP} = The name of the permission group that the command's being used on
#  {PERMISSION} = The permission required to run the command
#  {REGION} = The name of the region which the command's being used on
#  {SENDER} = The username of the player executing the command
#  {SUBCOMMANDS} = A list of valid subcommands
#  {TARGET} = The username of the player who the command's being used on
#  {WORLD} = The name of the world which the command's being used on
#  {VERSION} = Plugin version

#  You can add text placeholders here. Remember the formatting! E.G: For the placeholder "tag", you'll
#  have to write {TAG} when you want to use it in a message (See default messages as an example)
